^darkgray;Recording? Is this recording? Alright. I just sent out an SOS signal. I don't know where the hell I am. I was jumping into another system when I ended up in completely different location. This place doesn't make any sense. My NRU has no idea where we are or where to go. I think I'm lost, and I don't know how to return to where I came from, because this is not the deep space I know.^reset;",

^darkgray;This place should not be. There are structures, shapes... things too complex to fathom, as if they belonged to a different order of existence. My body feels weird, it feels like it's being pulled and twisted, it doesn't hurt, but it makes me feel uneasy. I think I'm hallucinating, some of the buttons on my console are gone, things are moving. It has only been 2 hours, yet it feels longer.^reset;",

"^#c58d44;Audio File AMR090733 - 0800^reset;
^darkgray;My arm had been attached to the console since an hour ago, was it an hour? I didn't even notice. It doesn't hurt, but it's not part of my body anymore. I'm confused, and I feel worse. It's getting hard to breathe, I see my chest, and now only my left side moves when I inhale. I don't know what's happening to me! WHERE IS THE EXIT!?^reset;"
