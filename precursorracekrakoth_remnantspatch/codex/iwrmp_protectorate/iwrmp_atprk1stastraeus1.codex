  "THE ASTRAEUS MISSION BEGINS
  
Greetings brave Explorer! You are being sent on the biggest exploration mission ever undertaken by Humanity, to explore the wild, unknown regions of the galaxy. Our compromise with the galaxy was announced with the creation of the Terrene Protectorate, and this mission is only but one step for the realization of that compromise.",

"As you understand, traveling in space is not easy. That's why you have been paired with a Navigation Router unit, it shall trace your FTL jumps with surgical precision! The least we want is for you to be lost in space. We, the United Terrene Government, want to thank you for volunteering in this important mission to help us realize our noble endeavor of peace for the galaxy. Farewell Explorer, and remember, you will always have an Earth to come back."
