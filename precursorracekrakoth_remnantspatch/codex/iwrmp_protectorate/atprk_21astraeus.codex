We don't mess with dimensional anomalies. I know that well, the reports are very clear about avoiding them; it seems that some of our ships throughout the previous Missions have been lost to them, either by accident or by trying to explore them, so far all of our automated probes have not come back from them either. I've known all this and I decided to mess with a dimensional anomaly anyways.",

"I won't hide this from the evaluators when we come back. I'll admit that I got carried away by ambition; you know, the 21st Astraeus Mission being a new era and all that stuff; I thought, what if we made a breakthrough? Then it was settled: we were going to explore a dimensional anomaly. But we decided to take a rather unorthodox approach. We attached a durable cable between a Messenger probe and our ship; that way we won't risk anyone by sending them in and probably killing them in the process.",

"We knew that we would lose comms with the drone, hence the cable. Foster decided to be the designated cable-cutter, just in case. The probe would then record what was in the other side. Genius, right? It is, because it worked! Well, sort of. The plan did work. We left the probe inside for 20 minutes, and then we started our boosters. It took our boosters at full speed for at least half a minute surprisingly, but we did it, we pulled the probe out.",

"We were ecstatic. We had recorded 20 minutes of video, and we thought we would finally see what's there. All we got was static, pure static, the whole video was just static and incomprehensible noise. We checked the drone, and it was weird, some of its parts were altered and, according to our engineer Arroway, some of the inner components seemed to be melted together or simply missing. You know what's the kicker? We sent the drone in for 20 minutes, yet it captured 14 hours of pure static. Odd, isn't it?"
