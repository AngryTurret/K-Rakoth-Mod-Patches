  "Simulacrum group: A
Status: Terminated - Simulation deemed a failure due to hivemind model not accurately emulating society.

Simulacrum group: B
Status: Extinct - Simulacrum eventually realized their true nature and elected to collectively self-terminate.",

"Simulacrum group: C
Status: Extinct - Simulation achieved technological level comparable to ours. Suffered societal collapse from over-extended logistics brought on by excessive colonization.

Simulacrum group: D
Status: Active - Unforeseen programming error led to inability to advance technologically beyond early stage. Patching deemed too costly and impractical. Considering adaptation into a control group to save on funding.",

"Simulacrum group: ^cyan;î€£^white;
Status: Unknown - Contact with group lost after apparent, and impressive, success. All subsequent attempts at regaining contact have met with failure in spite of evidence of continued activity."
