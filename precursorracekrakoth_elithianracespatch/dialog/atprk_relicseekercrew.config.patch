		"I can't believe yer people were guided by an actual Old One! I wish I could say the same 'bout my folks.",
		"Visitin' the Seat of Dhas would be a big deal for us Relic Seekers. If only we had the slightest idea how t' get there...",
		"What if perfectly generic items were created by the Centens? It only makes sense, if you ask me.",

		"Many planets have those small ruins on their surface... Who exactly built them, anyway?",
