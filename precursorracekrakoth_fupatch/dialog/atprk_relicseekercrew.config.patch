		"Learnin' about the races that came before us is excitin' and disturbin' at the same time. How many of 'em were out there?",
		"Why do many space anomalies turn out t' be mundane stations or asteroids? They give us nothin' new and waste our time.",
		"I can't believe how much the elder races've left behind. As if they didn't care about their property at all.",
