    "Those who follow Ri'shaan must stay vigilant in this world of chaos and uncertainty. Both all-consuming darkness and scorching light tempt thousands to betray our faith, to question the Growing One's benevolence. We must never listen to depraved whispers of the false gods.

But there is someone else who can stray you too far from the one true path.",

"Some beings go beyond merely luring people away from the Growing One's holy radiance. They try to impersonate Him in blasphemous ways, taking on similar appearance and mannerism.

The worst of such nefarious beings is ^#c41515;Tro'phess, or the Grand Impersonator^white;. Not unlike Ri'shaan, Tro'phess is a cosmic colossus with many planet-sized bodies, all linked together by invisible chains.",

"Mimicking the Growing One in many ways, the Grand Impersonator offers Their victims gifts made of a vicious blend of flesh and metal, promising great power and asking for loyalty in return.

One must remember that Their gifts and flattering speeches are nothing but a bait. Once you step into one of Their fleshy vessels, They will not hesitate to cloud your mind and drive you insane.",

"We can only wonder if this monstrosity is yet another forceful yet miserable being born out of the eternal conflict between the Inevitable and the Vehement.

There is no telling how long Tro'phess has existed. They could be older than the Growing One Himself but it is merely our guess.

It is only certain that one must avoid Them at all costs."
