    "Some planets are doomed to be eternal battlefields for the Inevitable and the Vehement. Their surface is plagued by a horrible amalgam of light and darkness, infecting everything it touches.

We have never seen realms more chaotic and desolate than those that orbit black holes.",

"Most of those abominable worlds are guarded by ^cyan;the Ancients^white;. What causes them to abandon their safe homes to move there is a mystery to us. It could be that the elder gods corrupt their minds and lure them with their cosmic traps, but we cannot be sure. We may never know.

There is something we know, however: not even our disbelieving brethren dare bothering those dire planets.",

"Unlike them though, we, the venerable followers of the Prophecy of Ri'shaan, could not ignore corruption. So we decided to settle on a few cosmic planets, the blinded Ancients notwithstanding.

We tried to bring Ri'shaan's blessing upon these warped lands. We tried to save them with our faith. We even brought materials to erect the Beacons.

And it yielded no results.",

"Not only were we forced to conceal our presence from the Ancients, those brainwashed heretics, we also had to fight against the cosmic elements themselves.

Ark'esh unleashed rains of stars and lightning straight from the heavens, taking down our shuttles. Nii'lah obscured our path, drowning everything in a vicious purple tint. What was even worse is that land itself seemed to surrender to this constant chaos.",

"Vast rivers of unholy liquids split cosmic plains in half, and whatever tried to enter them seemed to disappear forever. We lost many brethren that way: even our memories on them vanished into oblivion, and only notes we wrote prior remind us of those poor, forgotten souls.

Our disbelieving brethren were right all along. We should have stayed away. For now we are too weak to overcome this, and so are the Seeds.",

"Until Ri'shaan grows powerful enough, forget these misbegotten planets, for the curses of the Inevitable and the Vehement are too potent to reverse with our current efforts."
