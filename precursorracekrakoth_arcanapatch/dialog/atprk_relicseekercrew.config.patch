		"Your kind seems t' be very intelligent. Has any of your peers considered joinin' us, the Relic Seekers?",
		"We've got a lot o' knowledge to share, mark my words!",
		"Learnin' about the races that came before us is excitin' and disturbin' at the same time. How many of 'em were out there?",
		"Do you have your own mech? I thought it ain't easy to afford.",
		"Hello, fellow spacer! Got anything unusual? Some ancient relics, maybe?",
		"Don't mean to be rude but I forgot what your species is. You're human, right?",
		"Ever heard of K'Rakoths? Their race's been puzzlin' us for a while.",
		"For now our insight into different types of essences is shallow. But it only means that we have more to learn and discover!",
		"You know there's an elder race of aquatic squids out there? Forgot their name, though... again...",
		"We Novakids don't have well-written history books, so it's our duty to finally record everything right.",
		"An Arcanian, I suppose. Pleased to meet you. I've heard many good things 'bout your scholars.",
		"Once we're finished with K'Rakoths, we ought to explore the Celestial Corridors. In theory, they should give us more information about the Ancients.",
		"Space is kinda empty and dispiritin' at times, but if you search long enough, you'll always find somethin' wonderful.",
		"There are so many strange worlds that intrigue us. They seem to be affected by greater cosmic powers.",
		"Howdy, my name is <selfname>. Pleased to meet yet another curious spacefarer!",
		"The Ruin's true origin is shrouded in myths. Go figure how it was really born.",
		"Have your people found anythin' notable on Arcane planets? Like, any ancient ruins?",
		"Your people must've better memory than us Novakids. Why not join us? You can help us a lot on our journey."
